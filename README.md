The code is used for the analysis of the following paper:

**Brands, A. M., Ortiz, P., & Groen, I. I. A. (2024). Deep predictive coding networks partly capture neural signatures of short-term temporal adaptation in human visual cortex. bioRxiv, 2024-12.**

Required pacakges for the analysis on the pretrained PredNet (Lotter, Nature, 2020) are stated in _environment_keras.yml_. The packages for the analysis on the trained networks are stated in _environment_keras.yml_.
